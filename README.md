## User Authentication

Look in the `users.json` file for the usernames. While the passwords in the fixture are encrypted, the source password for every user is `Admin8*`

## Changing Your Database

You can run the `./seed-data.sh` script any time to make changes to database models, or just want to roll back your data to its original state. It deletes the database, any existing migrations, and then re-creates the database based on your current models, and inserts starter data.
